## Game Description

CapyDefenders is a AR (Augmented Reality) game where the player has to defend a big, golden capybara from waves of stegosaurus. The player can place capybara troopers in the real world and they will shoot at the enemies, as well as spells with magic powers. The game is over when the golden capybara is destroyed.

## Technologies used

In order to develop the game, it was used Unity and AR Foundation plug-ins to create the AR experience. In addition to it, Blender was used to create some of the 3D models of the game, such as the wizard hat, the tornado, and the lightning. The game was developed for Android devices.

## Game Models

The majority of the game models were imported from the Web, such as the golden and soldier capybaras, and the stegossaurus. The models created by the group were the wizard hat, the tornado, and the lightning.
The imported models can be found in the following links:
